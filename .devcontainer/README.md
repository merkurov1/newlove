# Devcontainer for newlove

Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote - Containers to get a reproducible development environment.

Post-create the container will run `npm ci` to install dependencies.

Ports forwarded: 3000 (next dev), 5173 (if needed).

Notes:
- If you plan to let the automated agent run git inside the container, ensure Codespaces is started and the workspace is fully mounted.
- This devcontainer is a minimal starting point â€” adapt Node version and features as needed.
