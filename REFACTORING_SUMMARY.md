### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] Write more unit tests (target 60% coverage)
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Update to Next.js 15 (when stable)
- [ ] Performance audit with Lighthouse

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
- [ ] Update to Next.js 16 (breaking changes)
- [ ] Update to React 19 (breaking changes)
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboard

### Long-term (3-6 Months)
- [ ] Microservices for integrations

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority
1. **Test the build**: Run `npm run build` to ensure everything compiles
2. **Update environment variables**: Add new variables for logging and security
3. **Monitor performance**: Check image optimization impact
4. **Review security headers**: Adjust CSP if needed for your integrations

### Medium Priority
1. **Write more tests**: Aim for 60%+ coverage
2. **Update dependencies**: Plan for Next.js 16 and React 19
3. **Add monitoring**: Integrate with Sentry or similar
4. **Document APIs**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Low Priority
1. **Optimize bundle size**: Analyze with `@next/bundle-analyzer`
2. **Add Storybook**: For component documentation
3. **Set up CI/CD**: Automate testing and deployment
4. **Add performance budgets**: Set limits for bundle sizes

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Incremental refactoring works**: Breaking down into small tasks made it manageable
2. **TypeScript migration is valuable**: Caught several potential bugs
3. **Testing infrastructure is essential**: Even if tests come later
4. **Security should be built-in**: Headers and rate limiting from the start
5. **Logging is crucial**: Structured logging helps debugging in production
