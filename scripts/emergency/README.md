Emergency artifacts and patches

This folder contains archived backups and patch files produced during an emergency hotfix.

These files are archived for traceability but are ignored by default (see .gitignore) to keep the repository clean.

If you need a specific archived file restored, copy it out of this folder and re-apply manually.
