# CI & Prisma: options to resolve missing schema.prisma

Problem: CI workflows validate Prisma schema and run migration checks but this repository does not include `prisma/schema.prisma`. That causes CI failures.

Options:

- Option A — Restore Prisma
  - Add `prisma/schema.prisma` back to the repo (or to a secure branch) and maintain Prisma workflows.
  - Pros: keeps full Prisma-based migrations, validations and generated client.
  - Cons: requires maintaining schema and migrations; may contain private DB structure.

- Option B — Make CI tolerant / remove Prisma validation
  - As implemented in `.github/workflows/migration-validation.yml`, make Prisma steps conditional on the presence of `prisma/schema.prisma`.
  - Alternatively, remove the Prisma validation job entirely if you no longer use Prisma.
  - Pros: avoids CI failures and allows incremental migration away from Prisma.
  - Cons: you lose automatic schema validation in CI unless you restore schema later.

Recommendation (safe default): keep the conditional steps (current change). If you intend to continue using Prisma, restore `prisma/schema.prisma` and the `prisma/` folder (Option A). If you're migrating away from Prisma, remove migration-related scripts and update README accordingly (Option B).

If you want, I can:
 - Restore a minimal `prisma/schema.prisma` stub (non-sensitive) to make CI happy (can be replaced later).
 - Or remove migration-validation job entirely.
